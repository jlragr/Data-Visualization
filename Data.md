
The dataset that I used contains the monthly population estimates for the US from April 1,2010
to December 1, 2017. I only used 2011 - 2016 because 2010's data wasnt complete for the entire year, and 
2017's data is more of a prediction since that is the current year. The dataset also includes different
populations for those time periods. Those different populations are:
Resident Population, Resident Population Plus Armed Forces Overseas, Civilian Population, 
Civilian Noninstitutionalized Population, and Household Population. I chose to use just the 
Resident Population because I felt using too many population types would create confusion while coding
the website and I wasn't sure what the best way to tackle that issue would even be. I got my dataset
from the United States Census Bureau. The links to the site and file are below.
