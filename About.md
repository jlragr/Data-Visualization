I created two index.html files, one that allows the user to choose a month, and displays the residential population 
for each year during just that month. The other index.html file allows the user to choose the year and displays the 
population for each month during that year. I did this because I was unsure which would be more appealling
to the user, and also because I noticed there was not too significant of a change in the numbers to 
visually see much change on the chart. This was an issue for both html files but I felt as though changing the
dataset or the chart type last minute would possibly create unnecessary errors and take up too much time where I 
wouldnt be able to submit the project on time.
